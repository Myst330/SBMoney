    <p> Tier 3, end game, the best, those that have progressed through the game more than mid-game. </p>
    <h1 style="color: #f56060; padding-left: 20px"> Ghosts </h1>
    <p> Ghosts are incredibly strong creatures that can be found within the Dwarven Mines.</p>
    <p> Upon entering the area they are located, "The Mist," a message will appear on your screen, warning of the dangers.</p>
    <p> These creatures cannot deal long ranged attacks, but their aura will harm you if you are within a certain distance of them.</p>
    <p> Entering the dwarven mines should be very easy, considering you're an endgame player. </p>

    <p>From destroying this creatures, you can get a variety of drops, and although most of them are quite rare, they are not as rare as tier 2's method.</p> 
    <p> Drops could include 1,000,000 coins, which has a drop rate of .01%, sorrow at 0.12%, and a few other pretty common items.</p>
    <p> This money making method is good because a sorrow will go for around 310,000 coins on the auction house. </p>
    <p> If you're wondering, sorrow is used to craft Sorrow Armor, which ironically, can raise your chances of getting more sorrow. </p>
    <p> Sorrow armor increases a stat called Magic Find, which increases the chances of getting rare drops.</p>
    <p> An item with a drop rate of 1% will be doubled if your magic find is 100, making it 2%</p>
