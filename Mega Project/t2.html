                <p> Tier 2, for what Skyblock players call "mid-game," known to them as not the best, but not the worst. "Meh," as one would say. </p>
                <p> I personally am a mid-game player. Or at least I view myself as one. </p> 
                <p> To cut to the chase, the tier 2 method of gaining money is </p>
                <h1 style="color: #f56060">Zealots</h1> 
                <p> Zealots are mobs that are found in the End Dimension, in the Dragon's Nest, Resembling vanilla Minecraft's "Enderman."</p>
                <p> Similar to the barn, you must enter a portal to travel to the End Dimension, and to get to the Dragon's Nest, you must travel to the End's deepest parts.</p>
                <p> Although using zealots as a method to gain money is a bit difficult. </p>
                <br>

                <span class="picture2">
                        <img src="eyeb.png" alt="Summoning Eye">
                </span>
                <p> The reason we use zealots for money is because there is a 1/420 chance for a special zealot to spawn, after destroying a normal one. </p>
                <p> Now you're probably confused. We uh, "destroy," a zealot (it's actually the k word, I don't want to get suspended) so that we get lucky enough that a special zealot spawns.</p>
                <p> Here's the thing. When destroyed, special zealots drop an item called a summoning eye (to the left). At the moment, summoning eyes sell for about 1,200,000 coins.</p>
                <p> Keep in mind, due to Skyblock being an economy game, prices will rise and fall rapidly. 
                <p> And because it does that, it makes gaining money a lot faster.</p>
                <p> But don't forget the 1/420 chance. It isn't going to spawn at your command. Unless you're really lucky, or you're an admin, but otherwise, you're going to have to destroy zealots for maybe 30 minutes.</p>
