                <p> As I probably mentioned, this method is popular. Competition is going to occur, and it probably won't be beautiful. </p>
                <p> For this strategy, we'll do what we last did for strategy 1. </p>
                <p> Since the Dragon's Nest is located at the very bottom of the end, you'll have to climb all the way back up to the portal </p>
                <p> ...Either that, or use commands, since abilities are usually futile, in terms of getting back up.  </p>
                <p> A user named PortalHub has created their island with multiple portals, leading to literally every dimension in the game. </p>
                <p> To use this, you'll want to type /visit Portalhub and then locate the End Portal. Then you enter, of course, and then you're back in the End Dimension.  </p>

                <p> This is an extra, a weapon called Aspect of the End </p>
                <p> This item does practically nothing damage-wise, but it has a nifty ability that allows it to teleport </p>
                <p> With a decent amount of mana, you would be able to zoom around the whole map, and in this case, zoom towards the zealots and hit them </p>
                <p> Make sure you don't sacrifice your damage for the bigger mana though, you want to make sure that you always destroy the zealot on your first hit. Don't let it know what hit 'em </p>
