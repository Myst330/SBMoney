<p> As I probably mentioned, this method is popular. Competition is going to occur, and it probably won't be beautiful. </p>
<p> For this strategy, we'll do what we last did for strategy 1. </p>
<p> Since the Dragon's Nest is located at the very bottom of the end, you'll have to climb all the way back up to the portal </p>
<p> ...Either that, or use commands, since abilities are usually futile, in terms of getting back up.  </p>
<p> A user named PortalHub has created their island with multiple portals, leading to literally every dimension in the game. </p>
<p> To use this, you'll want to type /visit Portalhub and then locate the End Portal. Then you enter, of course, and then you're back in the End Dimension.  </p>
