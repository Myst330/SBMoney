<p> Hypixel Skyblock is a game where you spawn on a floating island. To survive, you must use the resources that have been presented, such as dirt, a tree, seeds, and stone. (To the right) </p>
<p> Your next goal would be to use those resources to find a way to travel to the next island. </p>
<p> Upon entering the portal on the next island, you are sent to a multiplayer lobby, with infinite resources of almost everything you can name, but as usual, in-game money, in the form of coins, is needed to progress the game, and get stronger with the earlier mentioned "infinite resources." </p>
<p> That's what brings us to this website. This website will teach you different ways to gain/earn money in Hypixel Skyblock, with not just tutorials for beginners, but for late game players as well! </p>
<p> There will be three different strategies for each of the three levels, which will be classified as "tiers." </p>
<p> As you can probably guess, "tier 1" would be for beginners, "tier 2" would be for mid-game players, those that are not the strongest but not an absolute rookie either, and "tier 3" would be for end-game players, players that are very very powerful. </p>
<p> I'm personally a mid-game player, so tier 3 may or may not be accurate, but that's for you to find out. </p>
