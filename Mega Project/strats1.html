<p> When farming wheat, it is recommended you lobby hop. </p>
<p> Now you probably don't know what "lobby hop" means.  </p>
<p> Think about this. There are multiple lobbies of the Skyblock hub. Think of them as "alternate universes," where maybe one has a donkey, but the other has a horse. After breaking/collecting wheat, the farmland will remain. In a matter of a few seconds, that wheat will regenerate, allowing you to collect it once again. </p>
<p> Although there is a big problem within that sentence above. "In a matter of a few seconds." </p>
<p> As you've probably noticed, the yellow-ish parts of the picture are wheat. Large patches of wheat.
<p> Time is very crucial when it comes to farming, like speed. You'd obviously want to be as efficient as possible. </p>
<p> But with the brilliant mind of people- other than myself- I have concluded a way to counter this problem, with a method called "lobby hopping." </p>

<p> Lobby hopping is what it sounds like. Instead of waiting for wheat to regrow, you instead travel to an "alternate universe," where the wheat has already grown, and this can be easily done with 2 techniques. </p>
<p> The first technique is using commands in the chat. "/is" and "/hub". "/is" takes you back to your private island, where you first started, and "/hub" teleports you to the hub. This is an efficient way of lobby hopping, as you don't have to do much. An ideal situation is where you are transported into another lobby, where wheat has (hopefully) not been touched. </p>
<p> The second technique is using portals. Close to the wheat fields, there is a portal leading to the barn. It will send you to a place called "the Barn," similar to how "/is" sends you back to your main island. Upon entering the barn, you will be blessed with even more wheat. Before returning to the hub, it is recommended you wait a few seconds, and grab some more wheat while you're at it! A video attached will go over some more specific details.  </p>
