                <p> A Tier 1 player is an absolute beginner, a person that is playing the game for their first time. </p>
                <p> For Tier 1, I recommend farming wheat to sell to the farming merchant, located in the Hub. </p>
                <p> Farming wheat is quite efficient, because there is already a practically infinite amount of wheat fairly close to the middle of the Hub.</p>
                <p> Farming wheat does not need any particular tools or gear, thus making it a viable option for newer players. </p>
                <p> But farming wheat manually isn't the only way of farming, you can also install minions! </p>
                <p> If you aren't familiar with Skyblock minions, this is how they work: </p>
                <br>

                    <img src="minion.png" alt="Wheat Minion">
                </span>
                <p> Once farming enough wheat, your wheat collection will level up. A collection is basically how much you have collected something. As your collection level progresses, you will be able to craft/create more efficient, stronger tools. </p>
                <p> One of the most basic recipes you unlock is a minion recipe, unlocked at wheat I, meaning you must collect 50 wheat. Minions are usually crafted with materials matching their use. A minion farming wheat can be crafted by using wheat, a minion farming potatoes can be crafted with potatoes, so on and so forth. </p>
                <p> Minions, as mentioned earlier, do your work for you, making it easier to earn money. </p>
