            <p> These creatures are increadibly tanky, which in the "gaming world," means that they're hard to extinguish. </p>
            <p> Killing them in a single hit will be a difficult task, but there are weapons that can exploit this money making method very well. </p>
            <p> Such a weapon is the Soul Whip, a fishing rod- a whip- that allows you to hit or large amount of enemies at once for an okay amount of damage. </p>
            <p> Now it's quite evident that with the small amount of damage this thing does, using ghosts as a money-making method won't be the greatest. </p>
            <p> But, there is a way to make this method a bit easier, but more difficult at the same time.  </p>
            <p> I introduce to you.... </p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p> Giant's Sword </p>
            <p> The Giant's Sword is an extremely powerful sword obtainable from the depths of the catacombs. </p>
            <p> While it does cost 100,000,000 on the auction house, it is overpowered, boasting a whopping 500 Damage stat, and with enchants, it'd be even more powerful. </p>
            <p> To put that into perspective, the Aspect of the Dragons from the last level only has a 225 damage stat. That's less than half of the Giant's Sword! </p> 
            <p> Now you might be thinking, 'wait, these two weapons are good and all, but do I use them separately? It's not like I can take advantage of both of them at the same time... right?' </p>
            <br>
            <p> Now you may be wondering, "the soul whip would not do enough damage to kill ghosts efficiently, and the giant's sword requires me to get close to them, which makes me take damage." </p>
